Hello Benjamin! 
Please download the the files that are in your repository. Import them into Eclipse. You will notice we have an interface called SensorInterface. 
This interface MUST be implemented on the sensor classes that you will write. I also have an example coded in the form of temperature. Far from done, 
but it is a good example of what I'm looking for. Your data must be provided to the getData() method that you implement from the interface.
Our main program will use this method to get a new value every few seconds later. 

==Your task involves coding two classes. The classes are small and easy. I want you to program two sensors of your choice. You may want to look
at the Vantage Pro 2 and determine which 2 things you want to create a sensor of. You may create a pattern to how the data is derived or make
it totally random, but the one condition is that your classes MUST implement the interface mentioned, and the getData() method must be
implemented in that class. (See the temperature class if you're unsure about something). You can create any 2 sensors, and you can 
create any algorithm for the data creation, these things are fully up to your creative decisions.

When you're done, please upload your two classes in your branch. Don't upload to master class. Simply upload to your own branch.

Best and Good Luck, 
Ali Iftakhar.

Hello Tien! 
Please download the the files that are in your repository. Import them into Eclipse. You will notice we have an interface called SensorInterface. 
This interface MUST be implemented on the sensor classes that you will write. I also have an example coded in the form of temperature. Far from done, 
but it is a good example of what I'm looking for. Your data must be provided to the getData() method that you implement from the interface.
Our main program will use this method to get a new value every few seconds later. 

==Your task involves coding 1 new sensor and changing the TemperatureSensor Class. For the new sensor, you can look up anything in the Vantage Pro
2 that you want to include in our program, and simply create a sensor for it. It does not matter what algorithm you use to create data;
whether it is total random or follows some pattern. All that I do want is that you implement the SensorInterface, and the getData() method
which is part of the interface. If you are confused, check the example class I have coded for temperatureSensor to get an idea. Again,
you can create a sensor for anything(eg. Barometer, Air Pressure), and use any algorithm to create data(random or intentional values), as long 
as you implement the interface and the method of that interface. 
==Secondly, I know you wanted to code the temperature class to follow a specific pattern depending on the time of the day. Therefore, I'm 
giving you an optional work to rewrite the TemperatureSensor class according to how you see it fit. The only requirement I have, is the same. 
It must have the getData method and the interface implemented. I hope this gives you the creative freedom to express your unique ways
of deriving data, and you enjoy coding in this project. If you think it is fine, just leave it as it is.

When you're done, please upload your two(or one) classes in your branch. Don't upload to master class. Simply upload to your own branch.

Best and Good Luck, 
Ali Iftakhar.

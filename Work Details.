Hello Jonathan! 
I've uploaded our completed project in your branch. Your task involves writing Unit tests and making sure the code coverage reaches 90%. 
Regarding how you do your tests, that is totally up to you. Don't be stressed since you mentioned you're not very good with testing. 
After you guys submit, I always run my own tests and check the logic your code and make changes as necessary. Therefore, do you best and
be experimental! 
Best of Luck and have fun, 
Ali Iftakhar.
